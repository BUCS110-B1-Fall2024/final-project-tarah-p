## Project Description

A Sustainability Adventure is an educational game designed to teach players about environmental sustainability while providing an engaging gaming experience. Players complete eco-friendly tasks like sorting recyclables, planting trees, and conserving energy to earn eco-points. These points are used to upgrade a virtual city into a "Green City." The game combines education, entertainment, and interactive gameplay to create a unique experience.
